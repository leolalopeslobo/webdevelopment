## introduction
## html vs html5
sir tim, the first web developer who created the world wide web, has a governing body that establishes what html should look like so that the individual browsers (microsoft edge, google chrome, brave, safari, etc.) can know how to code their browsers in order to read html properly.
So HTML5 was the evolution where we try to add on features so that we can improve the user experience. HTML5 wanted to make websites more descriptive. Search Engines such as Google, go on websites and they use these things called crawlers (a program that systematically browses the World Wide Web in order to create an index of data, aka spiders) to understand and rank it accordingly. HTML5 introduces Semantics Websites which tries to improve the performance of the web.
